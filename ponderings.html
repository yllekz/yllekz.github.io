        <p>I don't care how "Greek" you think you are by being in a sorority. If you can't even pronounce the letter Phi correctly, you shouldn't even be in college, let alone a sorority.</p>

        <h3>Added 9/7/10:</h3>
        <p>I'll admit. When I was little (just beginning to get exposed to video games) I refused to open Internet Explorer on the computer because I misread it as a "Web Bowser."</p>

        <h3>Added 8/23/10:</h3>
        <p>When you go to a Lynyrd Skynyrd Concert, you don't purchase tickets for seats, you back your truck up to the stage.</p>

        <p>Cancer turns your life from a simple road to a 60 degree incline you have to scale with gigantic rolling boulders you have to dodge. Also, you're on fire.</p>

        <h3>Added 2/22/10:</h3>
        <p>Calling every 5 minutes will not get your problem fixed, the more you call, the more you annoy me, the less I want to fix your problem. Who agrees?</p>

        <h3>Added 1/27/10:</h3>
        <p>If the band Tool plays at a Home Depot, then what happens?</p>
        <p>"You speak English, how could you fail it?"</p>

        <h3>Added 12/20/09:</h3>

        <p>It is often kind of funny to see Steve Jobs do his hypocritical dance. He didn’t like video on MP3 players until he sold the video iPod, didn’t like multi-button mice until the Mighty Mouse, and thought Intel processors sucked until he used them. He has also been outspoken about how stupid tablet computers were because, OMG, you needed a keyboard until he brought out the iPhone and iPod touch, both of which are mini-tablets without a keyboard. He also appears to think screen touch is stupid, but making a touch mouse, multi-touch pad, and the coming Apple Touch Pad is brilliant. (EDIT: And now he thinks netbooks are stupid, while he unveils a barely functioning pathetic excuse for a tablet called the iPad....Steve Jobs, you fail.)</p>

        <h3>Added 11/1/09:</h3>

        <p>"The Macintosh uses an experimental pointing device called a ‘mouse’. There is no evidence that people want to use these things. I dont want one of these new fangled devices."--John C. Dvorak</p>

        <p>You know, with all of our advancing technology that is abundant, there is one thing, one friggin thing that still hasn't advanced with us, and that is the existence of a decent friggin nail clipper. I mean, dear God, when you clip your nails it always goes everywhere and there is no method of containing them other than manually doing it. Come on engineers, let's see some innovation!</p>

        <h3>Added 10/30/09:</h3>

        <p>SeCrEt SnUgGiE HaX:<br />Put your robe on backwards.... douchebags.</p>

        <p>"I made a song about an Octopus."<br />John: ...<br />Paul: ...<br />Martin: ...<br />Yoko: ...<br />George: ... Well, I think it's lovely.</p>

        <h3>Added 10/27/09:</h3>

        <p>Funny Counter-Strike Moments:<br />
        Guy 1: It would be great if you could SHUT THE F**K UP!<br />
        Guy 2: Wow.....you must have to live alone to be able to scream like that<br />
        Guy 1: Nope, I live in an apartment<br />
        Guy 2: hahaha, so who did you wake up?<br />
        Guy 1: I woke up my neighbors, and the people living next to them.</p>

        <h3>Added 10/26/09:</h3>

        <p>Don't play Saints' Row, steal real cars.</p>

        <h3>Added 10/25/09:</h3>

        <p>In my daily observation: It's quite funny to see a big grisly tough guy with a Harley Davidson shirt huddling over a small Macbook.</p>

        <p>"Turn down your speakers? It's a .gif image."</p>

        <p>My train of thought is so weird right now, I have 2 tabs open in firefox, one for a wikipedia article for Saw VI, and another for Carlos Mencia.</p>
