        Poog's Asbestos Land Song:

        There's a mechanical flaw in every ride,

            The air's pure carbon monoxide.

        The air's so bad that the rats will hide,

            Welcome to Asbestos Land!!!

        

        If you want food that's unorthodox,

            Filled with typhoid and smallpox

        With no warning labels on the box

            Come on in to Asbestos Land!!!

        

        Well you're walking around and you sit down,

                you sat in a place where someone hurled.

        But you gotta admit, its a whole lot better,

                Than waiting in lines at Disney World.

        

        All of the rides are covered in SARS.

            We have germs imported from Mars.

        I think the fumes just melted your cars.

        WELCOME TO ASBESTOS LAND!!!!

            Where your health concerns aren't ours.

        'Cause You're a Freshman

        Lyrics by John C: 

        It's your first day of school,

        And you're waiting for the class to start,

        The only one you know, in your sophomore geometry class,

        but oh-oh, there's a problem,

        everyone, i mean everyone, wants to kick your ass,

        so you're worried,

        you're distressed,

        but I'll tell you what the problem is in case you haven't guessed,

        it's 'cause you're a freshman,

        a good for nothin' freshman,

        yes it's true, everyone really does hate you.

        'cause you're a freshman, there's nothin' else to it,

        you're a freshman, and there's nothin' else you can do.

        So you're walkin' down the hallway,

        Tryin' to get through, with a backpack bigger than you,

        you're trying to find your English class,

        and you're sure, it's on the 4th floor by the pool,

        did anyone tell you, freshman,

        that you're a ****in stupid gullible freshman too?

        it's 'cause you're a freshman (man, you're a freshman),

        a good for nothin' freshman (freshman, freshman),

        yes it's true (God damn it freshman), everyone really does hate you (freshman, freshman)

        'cause you're a freshman, there's nothin' else to it,

        you're a freshman, and there's nothin' you can do.

        So you wanna know what's wrong with you,

        I can tell you in just a few words,

        the truth is that there's nothin' right with you,

        you God damn freshmen turds,

        so if that's just isn't good enough, then damn it, just leave,

        'cause we have no reason to hate you, except for the fact that you breathe,

        'cause you're a freshman (man, you're a freshman),

        a good for nothin' freshman (good for nothing freshman),

        yes it's true, everyone really does hate you

        ohhh there's nothin' else to it,

        freshman, freshman, freshman, freshman,

        yeah, that's it really. so get the hell out of our school. like seriously, all of you. And Brad, get yourself a damn girlfriend, huh? so yep, you got it, that's all folks, yeah the song is over now. no, i mean really, it's definitely over, finished, just waitin' for the fade out, you gotta do that sometimes.
