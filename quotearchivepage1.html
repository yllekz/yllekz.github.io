        Poog's Asbestos Land Song:<br />
        There's a mechanical flaw in every ride,<br />
            The air's pure carbon monoxide.<br />
        The air's so bad that the rats will hide,<br />
            Welcome to Asbestos Land!!!<br /><br />
        If you want food that's unorthodox,<br />
            Filled with typhoid and smallpox<br />
        With no warning labels on the box<br />
            Come on in to Asbestos Land!!!<br /><br />
        Well you're walking around and you sit down,<br />
                you sat in a place where someone hurled.<br />
        But you gotta admit, its a whole lot better,<br />
                Than waiting in lines at Disney World.<br /><br />
        All of the rides are covered in SARS.<br />
            We have germs imported from Mars.<br />
        I think the fumes just melted your cars.<br />
        WELCOME TO ASBESTOS LAND!!!!<br />
            Where your health concerns aren't ours.

        'Cause You're a Freshman<br />
        Lyrics by John C: <br />
        It's your first day of school,<br />
        And you're waiting for the class to start,<br />
        The only one you know, in your sophomore geometry class,<br />
        but oh-oh, there's a problem,<br />
        everyone, i mean everyone, wants to kick your ass,<br />
        so you're worried,<br />
        you're distressed,<br />
        but I'll tell you what the problem is in case you haven't guessed,<br />
        it's 'cause you're a freshman,<br />
        a good for nothin' freshman,<br />
        yes it's true, everyone really does hate you.<br />
        'cause you're a freshman, there's nothin' else to it,<br />
        you're a freshman, and there's nothin' else you can do.<br />
        So you're walkin' down the hallway,<br />
        Tryin' to get through, with a backpack bigger than you,<br />
        you're trying to find your English class,<br />
        and you're sure, it's on the 4th floor by the pool,<br />
        did anyone tell you, freshman,<br />
        that you're a ****in stupid gullible freshman too?<br />
        it's 'cause you're a freshman (man, you're a freshman),<br />
        a good for nothin' freshman (freshman, freshman),<br />
        yes it's true (God damn it freshman), everyone really does hate you (freshman, freshman)<br />
        'cause you're a freshman, there's nothin' else to it,<br />
        you're a freshman, and there's nothin' you can do.<br />
        So you wanna know what's wrong with you,<br />
        I can tell you in just a few words,<br />
        the truth is that there's nothin' right with you,<br />
        you God damn freshmen turds,<br />
        so if that's just isn't good enough, then damn it, just leave,<br />
        'cause we have no reason to hate you, except for the fact that you breathe,<br />
        'cause you're a freshman (man, you're a freshman),<br />
        a good for nothin' freshman (good for nothing freshman),<br />
        yes it's true, everyone really does hate you<br />
        ohhh there's nothin' else to it,<br />
        freshman, freshman, freshman, freshman,<br />
        yeah, that's it really. so get the hell out of our school. like seriously, all of you. And Brad, get yourself a damn girlfriend, huh? so yep, you got it, that's all folks, yeah the song is over now. no, i mean really, it's definitely over, finished, just waitin' for the fade out, you gotta do that sometimes.

        "First, it started in 6th grade. 'hey everybody! look, there's a new thing called AIM! It's so cool, you can send messages to people and talk to them!' then all of a sudden: 'hey look, did you know that there's a thing called a profile where you could talk about yourself?' And then it was:  "who cares about profiles? it's all about BuddyProfiles!' So everyone got BuddyProfiles. And then in 7th grade it was like: 'Hey, BuddyProfiles are old school now, did you hear about LiveJournals! You can post stuff every day in that stuff! livejournallivejournallivejournallivejournal' And then in 8th grade it was: 'LiveJournals? those are so stupid, it's all about Xangas now! you can post a lot more stuff in that!' And in 9th grade it was like: 'Xanga? I can't even pronounce that, it's all about MySpace now!' Each one progressively gave out more personal information every time.--Vikas
